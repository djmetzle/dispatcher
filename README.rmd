# Dispatcher

A simple to use process dispatch system.
Designed for running data manipulation pipelines.

### Usage
`./dispatcher` takes as an argument a YAML file specifying
a list of tasks, and their dependencies. See `test.yaml` for
a complete example.

### Warning!

Currently, the task verifier does not account for cyclic
dependencies. This can be a future feature add.

If you are not careful to avoid cycles in the dependency
graph, it will be possible to create a loop of tasks that
will stay stuck in the `:waiting` state indefinitely.
